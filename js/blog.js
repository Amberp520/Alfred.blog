After reaching an all-time high of $0.6651 on November 27, 2024, its price dropped by 69.29% . The coin's market capitalization also fell significantly, from $488 million to around $204 million The decline is attributed to several factors, including increased competition from other meme coins and concerns over intellectual property rights violations by the team behind Chill Guy . Additionally, the coin's creator, Phillip Banks, copyrighted the artwork and announced that he would issue takedowns for unauthorized merchandise and shitcoins .It's worth noting that the Chill Guy meme coin's popularity was largely driven by its viral presence on social media platforms like TikTok, where it was used to promote relaxation and self-care . However, its decline in value has led some investors to look elsewhere, with Doge Uprising being touted as a potential successor in the meme coin space.</span></p><button class='append'>Read More</button>",
